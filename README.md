# Noise Removal in Signals using MATLAB & Simulink

This project demonstrates the process of analyzing and removing noise from a signal using MATLAB and Simulink. The simulation covers signal generation, addition of noise, and application of various filtering techniques.

## Features
- Generation of clean and noisy signals
- Implementation of low-pass filters using Simulink
- Frequency domain analysis using FFT
- Comparison of filtered and unfiltered signal results

## Files
- Noise_Removal_Simulation.pdf — Project report with detailed explanation
- .slx file (if included) — Simulink model for filtering and signal processing

## Preview
Visuals showing noisy vs. clean signals and FFT plots.
